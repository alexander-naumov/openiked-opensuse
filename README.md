OpenIKED is a FREE implementation of the Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) protocol
which performs mutual authentication and which establishes and maintains IPsec VPN
security policies and associations (SAs) between peers.

The IKEv2 protocol is defined in RFC 5996, which combines and updates the previous
standards: ISAKMP/Oakley (RFC 2408), IKE (RFC 2409), and the Internet DOI (RFC 2407).

OpenIKED only supports the IKEv2 protocol.
